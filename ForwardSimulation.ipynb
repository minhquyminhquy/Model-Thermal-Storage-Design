    "\n",
    "Thermal energy storage is the device used in solar power energy to store the thermal energy absord from the Sun in the charging phase and release the energy during the discharging phase. The thermal energy is stored by heat flow between solid and fluid phase. In the charging phase, the hot fluid gets in from one end of the storage and heats up the solid. In the discharging phase, the cold fluid flow from the opposite end and absorb the heat, making the system cool down. Between these phases, idle phase take places - no fluid enter the storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "A cycle contains these 4 phase: (1) Charging (2) Idle between charging and discharging (3) Discharging (4) Idle between discharging and charging. This repeats until the thermal storage reaches a periodic or stationary  regime. [1]\n",
